##  SSR Pin - HE1
##  Thermistor - TB
[heater_bed]
##  Uncomment the following line if using the default SSR wiring from the docs site
#heater_pin: PA3
##  Other wiring guides may use BED_OUT to control the SSR. Uncomment the following line for those cases
heater_pin: PA1
## Check what thermistor type you have. See https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html#common-thermistors for common thermistor types.
## Use "Generic 3950" for Keenovo heaters
sensor_type: Generic 3950
sensor_pin: PF3
##  Adjust max_power so it doesn't exceed the SSR rating. The Omron G3NA-210B-DC5 SSR is rated at 4 amps without a heatsink.
##  The formula is "4 / (Wattage_of_bed_heater / Mains_voltage) = max_power"
##  If max_power is greater than 1.0, use 1.0
max_power: 0.6
min_temp: 0
max_temp: 120
